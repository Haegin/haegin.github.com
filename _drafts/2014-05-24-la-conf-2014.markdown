**The Good**

* Interesting two day format
* Some good talks
 - Joanne Cheng - D3.js
 - *Nathan Herald - Websockets*
 - Sarah Mei - application vs library development
 - Des Traynor
* Met loads of great people



**The Less Good**

* Some talks, while still being good talks in themselves, didn't seem that related to the tech conference they were presented at.

**The Bad**

* No WiFi. Seriously?
* Poor organisation
 - Nothing organised for the evenings
