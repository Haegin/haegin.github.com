I'm warning you all in advance, I'm using this category to post completely irrational rant posts about my final year project. Inevitably there are going to be times when I'm bashing at something for ages and then find it's just one simple thing I'd overlooked or one weirdness in how the code is done that I'd missed. For these times, this is the place I'm going to vent.

Now having said all that, my first rant is at Java and the Eclipse team. One of the classes that was used by the Eclipse plugin I'm continuing the development on was using a deprecated class and this is what I found when I went to get more information about it.
