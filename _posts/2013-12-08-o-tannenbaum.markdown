Today was the day of the Christmas tree. After a trek around town to all the places that weren't selling trees we finally made it to Holy Corner where we purchased a delightful little tree complete with a little log stand. We then hauled the tree home down the hill.

Once the tree was safely ensconced in our living room we proceeded to prepare the decorations and make hearty winter soup while waiting for the tree to fall. One delicious roasted carrot, parsnip and turnip soup later we were ready to enlighten and baubleise the tree.

Ta-da!
