I had a thought that in 2017 I should do a little more making and a little less
consuming. It's way too easy to get stuck into a loop of browsing websites,
flicking through Facebook and turning off in front of the TV so instead of
just doing that sort of stuff, I'm going to spend more time making things.

In fact, I'm going to make one thing every week for all of 2017. I'm calling it
#52WeeksOfMaking (because everything needs a hashtag these days). Stay tuned
to see what sort of things I make in 2017. Want to make more stuff too? Feel
free to join me on this adventure and share your creations using the hashtag.
Let's make cool stuff together!
