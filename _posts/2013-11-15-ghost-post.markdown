So as probably nobody has noticed I've switched over to using Ghost to run my blog. I imported all my old posts because hey, then I have content even if it is really old and largely irrelevant.

Unfortunately the URLs don't entirely match up. I'm not really that bothered by this and so probably won't fix it unless it causes some kind of unforseen problems.

The other thing I haven't done yet is migrate the Disqus comments across. This is also something I'm considering not doing. After all, I hear Disqus is covering sites in ads these days which doesn't sound too cool.
