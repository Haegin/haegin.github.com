During my studies at the University of York I've found or been recommended various computer science textbooks that are available online. Since I got bored of looking through my history to find them again I've compiled them into a list here. I'll try to keep it up to date.

## Programming ##
+ [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/)

## Concurrency ##
+ [C. A. R Hoare - Communicating Sequential Processes](http://www.usingcsp.com/)
+ [A. W. Roscoe - The Theory and Practice of Concurrency](http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/people/Bill.Roscoe/publications/68b.pdf)

## Cryptography ##
+ [Handbook of Applied Cryptography](http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/)
