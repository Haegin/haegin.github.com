About Me
========

- My name is Harry Mills and I go by the pseudonym Haegin online.
- I was born in Wiltshire and am now attending university in York. I'm currently on a placement year in Bristol.
- I'm currently studying Computer Software and Systems Engineering at the University of York. This is a five year masters course including a year in industry.
- In my spare time I tinker with my Linux system, work on various websites (including this one), read (mainly fantasy and sci-fi but I do venture into other genres occasionally), play tabletop role-playing games (mainly D&D in the past but I've been playing more Traveller recently), go walking (proper walking, not just to the shops and back), go cycling and go diving.
